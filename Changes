  - Timeout escalation: on timeout, send SIGTERM, then optionally escalate to SIGKILL
    after timeout_kill seconds if the child is still running.
  - Canonicalized timeout options: timeout and timeout_kill are the only supported
    keys (removed internal/accidental *_s variants).
  - Bounded parallelism and queueing: improved runtime configuration via
    $loop->fork_helper(max_children => ...); tests updated accordingly.
  - Public API introspection: standardized on running() / queued() / max_children().
  - Internal cleanup: tightened watcher/timer cancellation to prevent stalls or
    leaked timers when children exit or are detached.
  - Documentation: clarified execution model (callbacks run in parent; child runs
    exec/callback only) and expanded SYNOPSIS/options coverage.
